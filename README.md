# Deep-Learning-Based-Pneumonia-Detection-A-Study-of-Custom-CNN-VGG16-and-ResNet50V2
Overview
This project evaluates and compares the performance of three deep learning models—Custom CNN, VGG16, and ResNet50V2—for pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. By leveraging transfer learning and advanced architectures, the study demonstrates how deep learning can revolutionize medical imaging with minimal labeled data.

Features
